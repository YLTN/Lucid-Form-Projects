This is a website I've been working on for my school. I've stopped working on it
to learn more technologies and principles as well as getting better at web development
before coming back to it.

This one can somewhat handle responsiveness, so it'll look good in small and big screens.

Also, there is a nav menu button that appears if you have a small screen as a responsiveness
measure.
